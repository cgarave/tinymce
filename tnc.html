                    <li>Have made their first approved deposit to their 188BET account during the promotion period.</li>

                    during the Promotion Period, up to a maximum of MYR 988, as illustrated below:
                    <table>
                        <tr>
                            <td style="border: 1px solid black;">hello</td>
                        </tr>
                    </table>
                </li>
                <li>The Qualified Member is required to click on the “JOIN NOW” button within the Promotion-Specific
                    Terms and Conditions page upon login to their 188BET account at www.188BET.com to claim the Bonus.
                </li>
                <li>The Qualified Member is not allowed to cancel the Bonus once it is credited to their 188BET account.
                </li>
                <li>The bonus received and deposit amount used to generate the bonus (“Qualifying Deposit”) by the
                    Qualified Member from the Promotion are subject to a 15 times rollover requirement in 188BET
                    Sportsbook, Casino, Live Casino, Keno, Lotto and/or Financials before any withdrawals can be made.
                    General withdrawal rule applies for all other deposit amounts not used for the Promotion.
                    For Example: Qualified Member A has made the first approved deposit during the Promotion Period with
                    an amount of MYR 3,600. Member A will be eligible to claim the deposit bonus.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bonus amount = MYR 3,600 x 28% = capped to MYR 988</li>
                        <li>Deposit amount used to generate the bonus = MYR 988 / 28% = MYR 3,529</li>
                        <li>Deposit amounts not used for the promotion = MYR 3,600 – MYR 3,529 = MYR 71</li>
                    </ul>
                    Before any withdrawals can be made, Qualified Member A is subjected to rollover = (MYR 3,529 + MYR
                    988) x 15 + MYR 71 = MYR 67,820
                </li>
                <li>The Qualified Member is allowed to participate in only ONE (1) 188BET deposit-related promotion
                    during the Promotion Period. Should the Qualified Member seek to participate in more than ONE (1)
                    deposit-related promotion during the Promotion Period, only the first approved deposit received by
                    188BET from such Qualified Member for the relevant promotion will be considered valid and
                    participation in all other deposit-related promotions will be considered void.</li>
                <li>The Qualified Member will be disqualified from the Promotion if any withdrawals are made before the
                    Bonus is credited to their 188BET account.</li>
                <li>Only wagers in 188BET that generate a win/loss return will contribute to the rollover requirement.
                    Cancelled or void wagers, wagers on odds less than Euro 1.75 or Asia 0.75, or wagers on both
                    even-chances during a single game will not count towards this requirement.</li>
                <li>The rollover requirement will be considered fulfilled if the Qualified Member’s account balance is
                    less than the minimum stake amount allowed (i.e. MYR 5).</li>
                <li>188BET reserves the right to amend or withdraw the Promotion at any time.</li>
                <li>188BET is the sole arbiter of the Promotion and its decision is final.</li>
